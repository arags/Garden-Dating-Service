Feature: Change User Settings
In order to manage users
As a Gardener
I want to be able to change my XYZ settings (different settings than Manager?)

Scenario: Change user settings
Given: Account Management page
When: I change my XYZ settings
Then the settings are updated
And I see a confirmation that the settings have been updated
